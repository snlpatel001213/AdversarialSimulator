# Scanned 3D People Pack

**Renderpeople** is happy to provide you **ready-to-use 3D People** models to populate your Unreal projects. This pack contains a set of 9 photorealistic **scanned 3D characters** that are specifically designed to enhance the vividness and realism of renderings, like architectural visualization. Our complex photogrammetry based workflow ensures the highest level of authenticity and detail.

The fully retopologized **Rigged** and **Animated People** build upon the Epic skeleton and are completely compatible with Epic's starter animation pack. Moreover, all skeletal meshes have proper UVs as well as an optimized topology, so the skinning works fine to pose them in any and every possible way to achieve believable animations.

Each of the static **Posed People** models portrays a natural pose that has been captured exactly like this in our state-of-the-art photogrammetry scanner. The Posed People models have been refined and decimated to also suit every 3D environment.
