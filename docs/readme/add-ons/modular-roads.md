# Modular Roads

Quickly change between 1 lane and 2 lane roads

* Fully modular - use your own meshes and materials on each road segment individually!
* Auto-support added if the road is above the ground \(configurable\)
* Flexible Blutilities - Attach to other roads, align to surface, align landscape to the road, spawn end
* meshes and actors, clone roads, and even spawn connectors directly
* 2 types of connectors - 4 way and 3 way connectors with options for side walk meshes per corner and individual materials
* Add custom meshes to the side of the road - included light poles in this example with ability to define separation and material per road
* Flexible materials - change the road color and texture, change the visibility and color of individual lines on the road, and even add weather effects like rain or snow!
* BONUS - simple slope-based landscape material with grass and dirt, with option of adding snow

  3 demo scenes included - sunny, snowny, rainy to showcase the materials
