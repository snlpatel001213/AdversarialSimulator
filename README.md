# Adversarial Simulator

Adversarial Simulator allows one to simulate adversarial attacks in the virtual environment within the Unreal Engine and inference with Nvidia DRIVE SDK. This repository contains the code, assets, eample datasets, models, test results and a video demo for the paper :

***Abstract* -To study effect of adversarial attack environment must be
the same. Autonomous driving includes mainly 5 phases sense, perceive,
map, plan and Drive. Autonomous Vehicle 'sense' the surrounding with the
help of Cameras and Lidars. Deep Learning techniques are considered
Blackbox and found to be vulnerable to adversarial attach. In this
research we study the effect of various known adversarial attack in the
Unreal Engine based high-fidelity real-time Ray-Traced simulated
environment. This experiment seeks answer to questions like if
adversarial attacks works in moving vehicle scenario and can an unknown
network be targeted. We found that existing Blackbox and Whitebox
attacks do not affect all traffic signs uniformly. Attack found to be
affecting classification in static scenes are not similarly affecting in
the moving vehicle scenarios. However, some attack found to completely
block the identification of certain traffic signs.**
